                    <p>NGraphX is a node editor optimized for quick interaction which allows you to map out any information you wish
                        in a hierarchical manner. By laying out nodes in hierarchies you create an editable, navigable map of knowledge that can
                            be searched for different criteria of your nodes and their content.Although being run in a webbrowser NGraphX works offline, no data is being sent anywhere. 
                            Your data resides inside your browser's local storage. Your data is yours: no strings attached!</p>

                <p class="concept">Basics</p>
                <p>There are a couple of basic concepts you need to understand in order to work with NGraphX.</p>
                <ul class="docList">
                    <li>Every Network (e.g. collection of nodes) has a <b>root</b> node</li>
                    <li>The root node <b>can not</b> be deleted</li>
                    <li>The root node <b>can</b> be renamed</li>
                    <li>Every node <b>needs</b> to have <b>exactly one</b> parent</li>
                    <li>A node can have as many children as you wish</li>
                    <li>Nodes can be collapsed to hide their children</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="column one">
                <p class="concept">"Network"</p>
                <p>A collection of nodes is what is called a network in NGraphX. A network is always parented below a "root" node. 
                    You can save your network by pressing <b>"Save Network"</b> in the toolbar. The file that is offered for download when 
                    you press the save button, will always have the name of your "root" node. Usually browsers increment the filename when the file 
                    already exists: <br>
                    <i>rootName.json -> rootName(1).json -> rootName(2).json</i><br>This makes it easy to keep incremental backups
                    of your node network - which is very recommended! <br><b class="red">NGraphX is beta software. Save often!</b>

                <p class="concept">Where is my data?</p>
                <p>Your data is inside of your browser's local storage!<br>
                That is pretty good except for one thing: <i>you have to take care of it!</i><br>
                <b>Make sure to save your Network file before deleting browser data like cookies / storage etc.</b>
                The local storage is a special storage area of your webbrowser that websites can use on your computer. Every website can only access the local 
                storage for it's own URL. Read up on the local storage <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage">here</a>.

                <p class="concept">UX</p>
                <p>The User Experience Design for NGraphX is based on the concept of quick interaction and intelligent switching of focus inside the software. 
                    When you add a node for instance, the first thing you'll want to - always! - do, is to give the node a name, that is why it is automatically
                    triggered to give focus to the Node Name input field after adding a node. No need to touch the mouse! With focus inside the Graph Editor
                    press <i class="key">Enter</i> or <i class="key">Shift+LMB</i> somewhere in the empty and start typing as focus is switched to the Node Editor.

                        "Nodes" is collapsed, double clicking it, will uncollapse its children. "Toolbars" is the selected node. Double clicking

                        the name. If you want to add more information to this node press <i class="key">tab</i> and you will be on the <i class="key">+</i> button. 
                        Pressing <i class="key">Enter</i> now will activate adding a tag. After pressing enter again to confirm your tag, continue typing as another
                        input is generated for the next tag! If you do not need another tag, press <i class="key">tab</i> while leaving the input empty, which will take
                        you to the content field! After entering your content press <i class="key">tab</i> again which will take focus back to the graph editor!<br>
